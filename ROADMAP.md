# 🗺️ Neuro-OS Desktop Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for Neuro-OS Desktop. Our goal is to create the most advanced modular desktop environment in Python.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundation (Current Status: v3.0 RC)
- [x] **Core Architecture**: PySide6 + MDI System.
- [x] **Neuro-ID**: Basic authentication system.
- [x] **Package Managers**: Bridges for Windows, Linux, Android (ADB).
- [x] **Graphics Engine**: StarField Dynamic Backgrounds.
- [x] **Basic Apps**: Terminal, File Explorer, System Monitor.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Reactivity & Cloud (Next Steps)
- [ ] **Voice Command Integration**: "Neuro-Voice" module for desktop control.

### 🤝 How can you help? (Good First Issues)
If you are new to the project, check out these areas:
1. **Translations**: Help us translate the UI to more languages.
2. **Icons**: Create new icon sets for the "Neon" theme.
3. **Optimizations**: Profile the memory usage of `StarField` engine.
